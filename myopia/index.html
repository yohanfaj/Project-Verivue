          What is myopia ?
        </h2>
        <p>
          It is a vision disorder that results in blurred distance vision and sharp near vision. To explain it in a technical way, a myopic eye is an eye that is geometrically long. This means that the distance between the cornea and the retina is greater than normal. Myopia can also be due to an eye that is too powerful when the curvature of the cornea is said to be "too strong". This causes light to focus in front of the retina instead of on it, blurring objects in the distance. As a result, visual acuity is diminished.
